This is the website of my academic research activity at [Forest Canopy Ecology Research lab](http://groups.xtbg.cas.cn/canopy/about/) at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  I got it modified from [Allan Lab](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab). You can do the same mendion them as an appreciation.
