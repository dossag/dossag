# Open positions

**Note: We currently have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group.**




We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.
